abidos

Description

  Abidos will be a toolbox to improve navigation and refactoring c++'s code:

  - understanding of the system:
    abidos generates a set of diagrams (for now class diagrams with relations),
    you can see:
      * hierarchy between the class of the soure code
      * copositions/agregations
      * friend relations
      * members of the classes

  - the navigation across the source code of a c++ project.
    in a class diagram you can click in a member function or in an atribute of a 
    class and then go to the line of code automatically.

  - in a second phase refactoring code will be avalible, for now i have a very
    hard work doing the parser of c++.

  For now abidos has been started and be in a very early status of development.
  
Parts

  abidos for the moment has 2 parts and need refactor a great part of their
  code most of this code were a set of experiments.

  preprocessor
  this part of the project have his own Makefile and can generate a graph with
  the relations between the sources of a projects with his #includes

  processor
  this part of abidos is the core of the c++'s parser, it is a descent parser
  but i use parts of the code generating by flex and bison (mainly his .h) and
  the full scanner.

Intructions

  to see abidos working, for now i only tested this in a ubuntu system:

  1) download abidos
    git clone git@github.com:fructu/abidos.git

  2) testing preprocessor:
    cd abidos/preprocessor
    make all
    make execute

  3) testin processor:
    cd abidos/processor/
    make all
    make execute

thanks
  
  I use great pieces of code doing for great people without they my work would be
  imposible to start

  - c++ grammar with yacc and lex files.

  - graphviz a great sw to visualize information in form of graphs and networks
    http://www.graphviz.org/

  - XDot python code to see the graphs
    http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot
    git clone https://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca.xdot/

  - ubuntu

  - git

  - ...
